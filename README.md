### Hi there 👋

👋 Hey there! I'm Trung, a passionate IT professional with a focus on data analytics. I am currently a undergradute from RMIT University in Melbourne, where I majored in Information Technology. My journey in IT has been shaped by a keen interest in harnessing the power of data to drive meaningful insights and decisions.

📊 My toolbox includes a blend of R, Excel, and Python, which I wield adeptly to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data. Whether it's exploring trends, building predictive models, or crafting insightful reports, I thrive on transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. I am also on my path of learning and practicing with more BI and visualizing tools such as R, Power BI and Tableau!

💻 When I'm not coding or diving into datasets, you can find me exploring the latest advancements in data science, honing my skills through online courses, or contributing to open-source projects.

🌐 Let's connect and collaborate on projects that leverage the potential of data to make a real impact!
